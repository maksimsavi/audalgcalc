if the submit button was a button and not an input I wouldn't have to even mess with default event. But, might not have the same built-in
functionality a form has maybe?

I'll have to create a key to avoid spamming calls. see how people handle these things

operation order. when I call Fetch it sends the link, and receives a json.
then it takes the json, shoves it into state, and renders the table. on link submit it can reset the table too.

Display data:
How to display data? get it from server. put it into state?
Pass it to Table as props? 
when/ where would i need it?
should I clog the global state? or can i just give it to Table?
I dont need it anywhere else. I only need to display the data in the Table. Props make sense. 
I could pass it to the table, and refill the table 

if a component receives new props it will force render. 
if i pass new track props to Table it will rerender
in that case I only need to take new data from server, and pass it as props to Table.
In which case it will rerender. animation - later. since elements will show up as new it'll probably re-trigger animations by itself
